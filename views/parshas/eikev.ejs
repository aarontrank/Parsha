    <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> gave me the two stone tablets, even the tablets of the covenant. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to me, “Arise,

<div class='p'>
    <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Furthermore <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> spoke to me, saying, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Leave me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out

    had sinned against <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God. You had made yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> had commanded you. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I took hold of the two tablets, and threw them out of my

    with fire, and crushed it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>At Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked
    <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> to wrath. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you rebelled against the commandment of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God, and you didn’t believe him
    or listen to his voice. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>You have been rebellious against <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> from the day that I knew you. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So I fell down before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> the forty days and forty nights that
    I fell down, because <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> had said he would destroy you. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I prayed to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, and said, “Lord <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, don’t destroy your people and your inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you

        id="V28">28&#160;</span>lest the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ <span class="verse"
        id="V29">29&#160;</span>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.” </div>
