<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>On the eighth day, Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>and he said to Aaron, “Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt
    offering, without defect, and offer them before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without defect, for
    a burnt offering; <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> appears to you.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting. All the congregation came near and stood before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses said, “This is the thing which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> commanded
    that you should do; and <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s glory shall appear to you.” <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the
    people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> commanded.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Aaron came near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger
    in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar; <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar,
    as <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> commanded Moses. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The meat and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered the blood to him,
    and he sprinkled it around on the altar. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head. He burned them upon the altar. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He washed the innards
    and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin,
    like the first. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and
    burned it upon the altar, in addition to the burnt offering of the morning. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people. Aaron’s sons delivered to him
    the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver; <span class="verse"
        id="V20">20&#160;</span>and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh for a wave offering before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, as Moses commanded.
    <span
        class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s glory appeared to all the people. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Fire came out from before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>,
    and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, which he had not commanded them. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Fire
    came out from before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, and devoured them, and they died before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> spoke of, saying, </div>

<div class='p'>Aaron held his peace. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp.” <span class="verse"

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Don’t let the hair of your heads go loose, and don’t tear your clothes, so that you don’t die, and so that he will not be angry with all the congregation;
    but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> has kindled. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> is on
    you.” They did according to the word of Moses. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to Aaron, <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>“You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink whenever you go into the Tent of

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, “Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is
    most holy; <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons’ portion, of the offerings of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> made by fire; for so I am commanded. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The
    waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you: for they are given as your portion, and your sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.
    <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. It shall be yours, and your sons’ with you, as a portion forever,
    as <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> has commanded.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.

    given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>? <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly should have eaten
