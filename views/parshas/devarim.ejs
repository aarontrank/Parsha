<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It
    is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>In the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to
    all that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span><a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “<span class="thelord">The LORD</span>” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.</span></a> had given him in commandment to them, <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>after
    he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,

    <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South, by the seashore, in the land of the

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I spoke to you at that time, saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>You answered me, and said, “The thing which you have spoken is good to do.” <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them heads over you,
    captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I commanded your judges at that time, saying, “Hear cases between your brothers
    and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid
    of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do. <span class="verse"
        id="V19">19&#160;</span>We traveled from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea. <span class="verse"
        id="V20">20&#160;</span>I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God gives to us. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Behold, <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God has set the land before you.

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>You came near to me, everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall
    come.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of your men, one man for every tribe. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and
    spied it out. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God gives to us.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Yet you wouldn’t go up, but rebelled against the commandment of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>You murmured in your tents, and said, “Because <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> hated us, he has brought us
    out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we. The
    cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there!’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Then I said to you, “Don’t be terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you
    in Egypt before your eyes, <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and in the wilderness where you have seen how that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Yet in this thing you didn’t believe <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God, <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>who went before you on the way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by night, to show
    you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> heard the voice of your words and was angry, and swore, saying, <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>“Surely not one of these men of
    this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers, <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on to him and to his children,
    because he has wholly followed <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Also <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was angry with me for your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, shall go in there. Encourage him,
    for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Moreover your little ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give it
    to them, and they shall possess it. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then you answered and said to me, “We have sinned against <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. We will go up and fight, according to all that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up
    into the hill country. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your enemies.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So I spoke to you, and you didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>The Amorites,
    who lived in that hill country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah. <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>You returned and wept before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>; but <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> didn’t listen to your voice, nor
    turn his ear to you. <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> spoke to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>“You have encircled this mountain long enough.

    to pass through the border of your brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. Therefore be careful. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Don’t contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land,
    no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy water from
    them for money, that you may drink.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands.

</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So we passed by from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>“Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the brook Zered were thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> swore
    to them. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moreover <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s hand was against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they were consumed. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So, when all the men of war were consumed
    and dead from among the people, <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> spoke to me, saying, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>“You are to pass over Ar, the border of Moab, today. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>“Let me pass through your land. I will go along by the highway.

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to me, “Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.” <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Then Sihon came out against
    us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>We took all his cities

    before us. <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God forbade us. </div>
