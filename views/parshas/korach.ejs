    the priesthood also? <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>! What is Aaron that you complain against him?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up! <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with
    milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us? <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moses was very angry, and said to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Each man take his censer and put incense on it, and each man bring

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Korah assembled all the congregation

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these
    wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, their sons, and their little ones. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>If these men die the common death of all men,

    for they are holy, <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>even the censers of those who sinned against their own lives. Let them be beaten into plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. Therefore they are holy.

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>to be a memorial to the children

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s people!” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the Tent of Meeting.

    They fell on their faces. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>! The plague has
    begun.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He
    stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah.
