<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The time came near that Israel must
    die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>but when

<div class='p'>Joseph said, “I will do as you have said.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 48</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold,
    your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and
    said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’ <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now your two
    sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Your offspring, whom you become the father of after

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” </div>
<div class='p'>He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.” <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
    <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Joseph brought them out from between his knees,
    and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near
    to him. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn. <span class="verse"

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Joseph
    said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude
    of nations.” <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’ ” He set Ephraim before Manasseh. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Israel

    <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also of

    died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. </div>
