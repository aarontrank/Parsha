<div class='p'><span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All of you stand today in the presence of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God: your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>your little ones, your
    wives, and the foreigners who are in the middle of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water, <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>that you may enter into the covenant of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God, and into his oath,
    which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God makes with you today, <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>that he may establish you today as his people, and that he may be your God, as he spoke to you and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
    <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither do I make this covenant and this oath with you only, <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>but with those who stand here with us today before <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God, and also with those who are not
    here with us today <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the middle of the nations through which you passed; <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and you have seen
    their abominations and their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them); <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>lest there should be among you man, woman, family, or tribe whose heart turns away today from <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God,
    to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying,
    “I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the moist with the dry. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> will not pardon him, but then <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and
    all the curse that is written in this book will fall on him, and <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> will blot out his name from under the sky. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> will set him apart for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the
    curses of the covenant written in this book of the law. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> has made
    it sick, <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span> that all of its land is sulfur, salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> overthrew
    in his anger, and in his wrath. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Even all the nations will say, “Why has <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then men will say, “Because they abandoned the covenant of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and
    went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know and that he had not given to them. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s anger burned against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written
    in this book. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> rooted them out of their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them into another land, as it is today.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The secret things belong to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law. </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations where <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God has driven you,
    <span

        you from captivity, have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples where <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God has scattered you. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For this commandment which I command you today is not too hard for you or too distant. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It is not in heaven, that you should say, “Who will go up for us to heaven,
    bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?” <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, “Who will go over the sea for us, bring it to us, and proclaim it to us, that we may do it?”
    <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, I have set before you today life and prosperity, and death and evil.
    <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For I command you today to love <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God may bless you
    in the land where you go in to possess it. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other gods, and serve them, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>I declare
    to you today that you will surely perish. You will not prolong your days in the land where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that I have
    set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your descendants, <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>to love <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your
