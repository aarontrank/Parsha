<div class='m'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
    to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; <span class="verse"
        id="V19">19&#160;</span>and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and what the land is, whether
    it is fertile or poor, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman,
    Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes,
    and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from
    there. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
    to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us.
    Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there.
    <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!” </div>

    they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature. <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>There
    we saw the Nephilim,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> or, giants</span></a> the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim.<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> or, giants</span></a> We were in our own sight as grasshoppers,

    or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?” <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into Egypt.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They spoke to all the congregation of the children
    of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which flows with
