<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jacob lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding
    the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,
    because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a tunic of many colors. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.
    </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed: <span class="verse"
        id="V7">7&#160;</span>for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>His brothers asked him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He dreamed
    yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.” <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>He told it to his father and to his
    brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?” <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>His brothers
    envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to
    them.” He said to him, “Here I am.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. <span class="verse"
        id="V15">15&#160;</span>A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They said
    to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of
    his dreams.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.” <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in
    the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors
    that was on him; <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
    <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood? <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand
    be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites
    for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Reuben returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where
    will I go?” <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They took the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their
    father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your son’s tunic or not.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s tunic. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.” <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth
    on his waist, and mourned for his son many days. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Sheol is the place of the dead.</span></a>    to my son, mourning.” His father wept for him. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 38</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named
    Shua. He took her, and went in to her. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.
    <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
    <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s sight. So <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> killed him. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother
    to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.” <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring
    to his brother. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The thing which he did was evil in <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s sight, and he killed him also. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your
    father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Tamar
    was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of
    Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
    <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law. </div>
<div class='p'>She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” </div>
<div class='p'>She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He said, “What pledge will I give you?” </div>
<div class='p'>She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.” </div>
<div class='p'>He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Judah
    sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that
    was at Enaim by the road?” </div>
<div class='p'>They said, “There has been no prostitute here.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’ ” <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest
    we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.” </div>
<div class='p'>Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.” <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the
    signet, and the cords, and the staff.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.” </div>
<div class='p'>He knew her again no more. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet
    thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.” <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez.

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 39</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span>
    was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>His master saw that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was with him, and that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> made all that he did prosper in his hand. <span class="verse"
        id="V4">4&#160;</span>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>From the time that he made him overseer
    in his house, and over all that he had, <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand.
    He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. </div>
<div class='p'>Joseph was well-built and handsome. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>After these things, his master’s wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>No one is greater
    in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>About this time, he went into the house to do his work, and there were
    none of the men of the house inside. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” </div>
<div class='p'>He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside, <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>she called to the men of her house, and
    spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his
    garment by me, and ran outside.” <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>She spoke to him according to these words, saying, “The Hebrew servant,
    whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me, <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, “This is what your servant did to me,” his wrath was kindled. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Joseph’s master took him,
    and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper
    of the prison. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for it. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The
    keeper of the prison didn’t look after anything that was under his hand, because <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was with him; and that which he did, <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> made it prosper. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 40</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>After these things, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cup bearer
    and the chief baker. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The captain of the guard assigned
    them to Joseph, and he took care of them. They stayed in prison many days. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the cup bearer
    and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He asked Pharaoh’s
    officers who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad today?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They said to him, “We have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it.” </div>
<div class='p'>Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Please tell it to me.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The chief cup bearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me, <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and in the vine were three branches. It was as though
    it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters produced ripe grapes. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head, and restore you to your
    office. You will give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But remember me when it is well with you. Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and
    bring me out of this house. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, “I also was in my dream, and behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head. <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In
    the uppermost basket there were all kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you, and will hang
    you on a tree; and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.” <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and
    the head of the chief baker among his servants. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>He restored the chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but he hanged
    the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Yet the chief cup bearer didn’t remember Joseph, but forgot him. </div>
