<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> had brought Israel out of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Jethro,
    Moses’ father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her away, <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and her two sons. The name of one son was Gershom,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Gershom” sounds like the Hebrew for “an alien there”.</span></a>    for Moses said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land”. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The name of the other was Eliezer,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> Eliezer means “God is my helper”. </span></a> for he
    said, “My father’s God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh’s sword.” <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the Mountain
    of God. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Moses told his father-in-law all
    that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had come on them on the way, and how <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> delivered them. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>
    had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Jethro said, “Blessed be <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh;
    who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now I know that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> is greater than all gods because of the way that they treated people arrogantly.”
    <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron came with all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>On the next day, Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to
    the people, he said, “What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor,
    and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.” <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you do is not good. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>You will surely wear away, both
    you, and this people that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to perform it yourself alone. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Listen now to my voice. I will give you counsel, and God be with you. You represent
    the people before God, and bring the causes to God. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. <span class="verse"
        id="V21">21&#160;</span>Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
    <span
        class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let them judge the people at all times. It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge themselves. So shall it be easier for you, and they shall share the load with you. <span class="verse"
            id="V23">23&#160;</span>If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will go to their place in peace.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers
    of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They judged the people at all times. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
    <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into his own land. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When they had departed from
    Rephidim, and had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mountain. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Moses went up to God, and <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> called to him out of the mountain, saying,
    “This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself.
    <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples; for all the earth is mine; <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and you
    shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> commanded him. <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All the people answered together, and said, “All that
    <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> has spoken we will do.” </div>
<div class='p'>Moses reported the words of the people to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever.” Moses told the
    words of the people to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to Moses, “Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments, <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and be ready for
    the third day; for on the third day <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>You shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t go up onto the mountain,
    or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.’ When
    the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He said to the people, “Be ready by the third day. Don’t
    have sexual relations with a woman.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.
    <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain. <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>All of Mount Sinai smoked, because <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> descended on it in
    fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
    <span
        class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> to gaze, and many of them perish. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Let the priests also, who come near to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>,
    sanctify themselves, lest <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> break out on them.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Moses said to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, “The people can’t come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, lest he break out against them.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Moses went down to the people, and told them. </div>
