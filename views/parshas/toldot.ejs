<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of
    Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Isaac entreated <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> for his wife, because she was barren. <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
    <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> said to her,
</div>
<div class='q'>“Two nations are in your womb. </div>
<div class='q'>Two peoples will be separated from your body. </div>
<div class='q'>The one people will be stronger than the other people. </div>
<div class='q'>The elder will serve the younger.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.
    <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved
    Jacob. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.”
    Therefore his name was called Edom.<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Edom” means “red”.</span></a> </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.” </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” </div>
<div class='p'>He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>There was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> appeared
    to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these

    nations of the earth will be blessed, <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Isaac lived in Gerar. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the
    place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.” <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing
    Rebekah, his wife. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’ ” </div>
<div class='p'>Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> blessed him. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became
    very great. <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Now all the wells which his father’s servants
    had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father
    had called them. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The
    water is ours.” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah. <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He
    left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He went up from there to Beersheba. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span><span class="thelord">The LORD</span> appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He built an altar there, and called on <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me,
    and have sent me away from you?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They said, “We saw plainly that <span class="thelord">The LORD</span> was with you.

    you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from
    him in peace. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>He called it “Shibah”.
    <a

<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>When Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said to him, “My son?” </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said, “See now, I am old. I don’t know the day of my death. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and get me venison.

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son,

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>He came to his father, and said, “My father?” </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Jacob went near to Isaac his father. He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He didn’t recognize him, because his

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>He said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright. See, now he has taken away my blessing.” He said, “Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Esau said to his father, “Do you have just one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, my father.” Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. </div>
