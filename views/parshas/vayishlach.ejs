<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau:
    ‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that
    I may find favor in your sight.’ ” <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then
    Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and he said, “If Esau comes to the one company, and
    strikes it, then the company which is left will escape.” <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, <span class="thelord">The LORD</span>, who said to me, ‘Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will
    do you good,’ <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I have become

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He stayed there that night, and took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother: <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes
    and twenty rams, <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He delivered them into the hands of his servants,
    every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd.” <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He commanded the foremost, saying, “When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose
    are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?’ <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant, Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.’ ”
    <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>You shall say, ‘Not
    only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’ ” For, he said, “I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the camp. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok. <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>He took them, and sent them over
    the stream, and sent over that which he had. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>When he saw that he didn’t prevail

<div class='p'>Jacob said, “I won’t let you go unless you bless me.” </div>

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He
    put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he

        id="V11">11&#160;</span>Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.” He urged him, and he took it. </div>
