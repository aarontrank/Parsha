<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>At the end of two full years, Pharaoh dreamed, and behold, he stood by the river. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Behold, seven cattle came up out of the river. They were sleek and fat, and they fed
    in the marsh grass. <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink of the river. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The ugly
    and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke. <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He slept and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good. <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Behold,
    seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. <span class="verse"
        id="V8">8&#160;</span>In the morning, his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then the chief cup bearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I remember my faults today. <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the captain
    of the guard, with the chief baker. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We dreamed a dream in one night, he and I. Each man dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream. <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>There was with us
    there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man according to his dream. <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>As he interpreted to us, so it was.
    He restored me to my office, and he hanged him.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon. He shaved himself, changed his clothing, and came in to Pharaoh. <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Pharaoh said
    to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it. I have heard it said of you, that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “It isn’t in me. God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I stood on the brink of the river; <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, fat and sleek. They fed
    in the marsh grass; <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for ugliness. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The
    thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle; <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and when they had eaten them up, it couldn’t be known that they had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
    <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good; <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted with the
    east wind, sprung up after them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dream of Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh. <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good
    heads of grain are seven years. The dream is one. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be
    seven years of famine. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>That is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Behold, seven years of great plenty throughout
    all the land of Egypt are coming. <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The famine will consume the land,
    <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which follows; for it will be very grievous. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the
    thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>“Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land,
    and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years. <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the
    cities, and let them keep it. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>The food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through the famine.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the
    Spirit of God?” <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you. <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>You shall be over my house. All my
    people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will be greater than you.” <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Pharaoh
    took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck. <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>He made him ride in the second chariot which he had. They
    cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.”
    <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>In
    the seven plenteous years the earth produced abundantly. <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from
    the fields around that city. <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting, for it was without number. <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>To Joseph were born
    two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Manasseh” sounds like the Hebrew for “forget”.</span></a>    “For”, he said, “God has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.” <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>The name of the second, he called Ephraim:<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> “Ephraim” sounds like the Hebrew for “twice fruitful”.</span></a>    “For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all
    lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to
    you, do.” <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>The famine was over all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>All
    countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth. </div>
<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 42</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?” <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.
    Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live, and not die.” <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin,
    Joseph’s brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to him.” <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
    <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Joseph was the governor over the land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth. <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Joseph
    saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?” </div>
<div class='p'>They said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn’t recognize him. <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come
    to see the nakedness of the land.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>We are all one man’s sons; we are honest men. Your servants are not spies.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They said, “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Joseph said to them, “It is like I told you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>By this you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from here, unless your
    youngest brother comes here. <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you
    are spies.” <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He put them all together into custody for three days. </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Joseph said to them the third day, “Do this, and live, for I fear God. <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your prison; but you go, carry
    grain for the famine of your houses. <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified, and you won’t die.” </div>
<div class='p'>They did so. <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They said to one another, “We are certainly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has come upon
    us.” <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Reuben answered them, saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.” <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>They
    didn’t know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>He turned himself away from them, and wept. Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them,
    and bound him before their eyes. <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack, and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them.
</div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there. <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he saw his money.
    Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>He said to his brothers, “My money is restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this
    that God has done to us?” <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to them, saying, <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>“The man, the lord of the
    land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country. <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>We said to him, ‘We are honest men. We are no spies. <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father;
    one is no more, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan.’ <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>The man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers with
    me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way. <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Bring your youngest brother to me. Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So I will deliver your brother
    to you, and you shall trade in the land.’ ” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>As they emptied their sacks, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Jacob, their
    father, said to them, “You have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Reuben spoke to his father, saying, “Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him to you again.” </div>
<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”

<div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>The famine was severe in the land. <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”
